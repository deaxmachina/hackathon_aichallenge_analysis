Comune di Ferrara,2007,1582605, 11.885 ,133155,2016,"The Baseline Emissions Inventory (BEI) was created according to the methodological instrument made available by Emilia-Romagna Region, with the technical-scientific support of the ARPA (Regional Agency for the Prevention and the Environment) within the Climate Plans regional work group, in which the Municipality of Ferrara participates. The cognitive foundation for producing the inventory is represented by the regional inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, created by the Emilia-Romagna Region and ARPA Emilia-Romagna, according to the standard methods of estimation recognised on an international level (IPCC, CORINAIR). To construct this regional inventory, the INEMAR software was used (INventario EMissioni ARia: Air Emissions Inventory), which consists of an application system created to estimate the emissions of various pollutants, for various types of activity (e.g.: heating, traffic, agriculture and industry) and by type of fuel, according to the international classification adopted in the field of EMEP-CORINAIR inventories. As envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines, in order to calculate emissions, the “bottom‐up” method was used, based on the sector end-use of fuels. In those cases where it was not possible to obtain accurate data, particularly concerning territorial data, a ""top-down"" approach was used, resorting to statistical processing of data aggregated at a provincial level. The overall picture of emissions of the Terre Estensi Association was built from the emissions inventory of the individual Municipalities of Ferrara, Masi Torello and Voghiera that constitute the Association, making the sum of the contributions of the three Municipalities. In line with the agreements within the Regional Work Group on Climate Plans, the year 2007 was chosen as a baseline reference year. The classification of the sources was created in accordance with the Cartesio Guidelines, which correspond with the ICLEI Protocol and ISO 14064."

City of Baltimore,2010,7579144, 12.170 ,622793,2016,"ICLEI’s methodology provides a systematic framework for local governments to track energy- and waste-related activities in the community, and to calculate the amounts of greenhouse gases produced by each activity and sector. The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations. Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures. Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts. Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records. For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs."

This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints. The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying.

Transport Sector: disaggregated into freight, private vehicle and public transport (bus,minibus taxi and train) The City's GHG account/inventory for its most recent State of Energy Report (Report released in 2015 based on 2012 data year) is based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Draft v2 (GPC). Emissions factors draw on those of the IPCC (web based and regularly updated) for South Africa, as well as Eskom for local electricity emissions factors. In the Cape Town GPC summary table provided, Scope 1 includes all emissions that physically take place within the Cape Town area. This includes liquid fuels consumed and coal. Even if that liquid fuel is moved out of the area, it is still accounted for as per point of sale. This scope includes the emissions from Ankerlig and Acacia power stations (Energy supplied to the grid - territorial); but these are removed in the final balance for Cape Town as per protocol (this is accounted for within national electricity production accounts of Eskom). Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity produced elsewhere in the country, but consumed in Cape Town. This column accounts for the majority of these emissions, but a small portion are recorded in Scope 3, reflecting that component of the emissions factor that relates to Transmission and distribution (i.e. from power station to municipal boundary; and amounting to 0.04 of the 1.03 emissions factor).

These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry. GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases. A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration. GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system. It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay, For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif. Composting - BH also conducts composting for organic waste. These activities take place in the CTRS Rod BR-040 and may incur nitrous oxide and methane."

National Grid reported natural gas use data for Brooklyn, parts of Queens, and Staten Island. The Long Island Power Author- ity (LIPA) reported electricity use data for the Rockaways area of Queens. Fuel oil use was provided by private fuel oil suppliers, per Local Law 43 of 2013, which requires fuel oil providers to report fuel oil deliveries by fuel type to the City on an annual basis. The New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) provided on-road transportation vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) data. Energy use data for public transit were provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) for New York City Transit (NYCT) subways and buses, Staten Island Railway (SIR), MTA Metro-North Rail Road (MNR) and Long Island Railroad (LIRR) commuter rail, and MTA Bus Company buses; by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) for Trans-Hudson (PATH) commuter rail; and New Jersey Transit (NJT) for its commuter rail and buses. Data used to calculate fugitive and process CH4 and process N2O from wastewater treatment were provided by DEP. CH4 emissions were calculated based on the destruction of volatile material in anaerobic digesters. Based on the measured concentration and flow of volatile organic solids, it is estimated that 15 cubic feet of digester gas is produced for every pound of volatile organic solids destroyed. N2O emissions were calculated by applying the daily nitrogen load discharged by each of the City’s 14 wastewater treatment plant to the formula in the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from in-city landfills was calculated from landfill gas collection data provided by the New York City Department of Sani- tation (DSNY) and DEP per the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from exported solid waste was calculated using waste disposal figures for resi- dential, commercial, and construction and demolition waste and applying emissions factors from the USCP, which were taken from EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Fugitive CH4 from natural gas distribution was calculated using data provided by National Grid and ConEd. Fugitive SF6 from electricity distribution was cal- culated using data provided by ConEd. ."

Recently the City has also developed GPC BASIC inventories for the 2005/06, 2013/14 and 2014/15 years to be compliant with the Compact of Mayors. The GPC BASIC inventories show lower emissions compared with inventories based on the CCAP tool due to different methodologies and emissions sources. Future year’s reports may be subject to change as the City of Sydney will be updating its inventories in the short term for achieving beyond GPC BASIC compliance."

Industrial activities in the port area encompasses several energy production plants, therefore scope 2 emissions from the industry are not computed. We only monitor scope 2 emissions for the built environment. This number is filled in in C1.5 but is not used for the monitoring of the RCI target. An inventory was made on the emissions in 2009 and 2011 of other green house gases, but these numbers have limited accuracy. Therefore, these numbers are not included in C1.5. The most recent data that are now (April, 2016) available refer to the situation in 2014."
